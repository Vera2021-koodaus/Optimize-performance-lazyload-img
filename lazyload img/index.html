            <h1>Composition of the Solar System</h1>
            <p>
                Located at the centre of the solar system and influencing the motion of all the other 
                bodies through its gravitational force is the Sun, which in itself contains more than 
                99 percent of the mass of the system. The planets, in order of their distance outward 
                from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. 
                Four planets—Jupiter through Neptune—have ring systems, and all but Mercury and Venus 
                have one or more moons. Pluto had been officially listed among the planets since it 
                was discovered in 1930 orbiting beyond Neptune, but in 1992 an icy object was discovered 
                still farther from the Sun than Pluto. Many other such discoveries followed, including 
                an object named Eris that appears to be at least as large as Pluto. It became apparent 
                that Pluto was simply one of the larger members of this new group of objects, collectively 
                known as the Kuiper belt. Accordingly, in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union 
                (IAU), the organization charged by the scientific community with classifying astronomical objects, 
                voted to revoke Pluto’s planetary status and place it under a new classification called dwarf planet. 
                For a discussion of that action and of the definition of planet approved by the IAU, see planet.

            <h1>Planets and Their Moons</h1>
            <p>
                The relatively small inner planets have solid surfaces, lack ring systems, 
                and have few or no moons. The atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars are composed
                 of a significant percentage of oxidized compounds such as carbon dioxide. 
                 Among the inner planets, only Earth has a strong magnetic field, which shields 
                 it from the interplanetary medium. The magnetic field traps some of the 
                 electrically charged particles of the interplanetary medium inside a region 
                 around Earth known as the magnetosphere. Heavy concentrations of these 
                 high-energy particles occur in the Van Allen belts in the inner part of the 
                 magnetosphere.

            <p>
                All the planets and dwarf planets, the rocky asteroids, and the icy bodies in the Kuiper belt move 
                around the Sun in elliptical orbits in the same direction that the Sun rotates. This motion is termed 
                prograde, or direct, motion. Looking down on the system from a vantage point above Earth’s North Pole, 
                an observer would find that all these orbital motions are in a counterclockwise direction. In striking 
                contrast, the comet nuclei in the Oort cloud are in orbits having random directions, corresponding 
                to their spherical distribution around the plane of the planets.
